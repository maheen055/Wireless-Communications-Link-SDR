# Wireless-Communications-Link-SDR
This project aims to design and implement a wireless communications link using Software-Defined Radio (SDR) technology. The primary objective is to gain practical experience in wireless communication principles by creating a unidirectional link that transmits and receives digital data over-the-air using MATLAB and SDR hardware.
